<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
    <p>We are Defne Uyan, Rüya Bilgin, Suzan Yüksel, Duru Hira Bozdemir, Ceylin Döndar and Berru Beste Şahin from 
    Bahçeşehir College, Dalaman Campus in Türkiye. We joined the space apps challenge with the intention of helping humankind. 
    Since we are all deeply interested in science and technology 
    this challenge was a big opportunity and a big honor for us. </p>
    
    <center><h1>3D MODEL OF A VOLCANO USING SAR TECHNOLOGY, A PROJECT</h1></center>
    <h2>OUR PROJECT SUMMARY:</h2>
    <p>Our mission with the project "Model of a Volcano Using SAR Technology" is to recreate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar">
        SAR (synthetic aperture radar) </a> images with an innovative approach 
        that is understandable to everyone. Since the appearance of SAR data, which is generally 
        transferred to a 2-dimensional plane, is complicated, it does not appeal to all ages and 
        many people have difficulty understanding it. In order to make the SAR data more understandable, 
        we made the before and after volcano eruption, which we chose as an example case, more tangible and 
        visible by transferring it to a three-dimensional plane. In addition, since young people will 
        have difficulty understanding if they see colors that they have trouble distinguishing, we colored our SAR model 
        by using easily distinguishable primary colors in the color chart we used.In addition, we set up a website we designed that includes the details 
        of our project and all other necessary information so that our project can reach the audience we want to 
        reach more easily and practically. To summarize, we interpreted the SAR data with a unique approach with 
        the 3D model we created and made complex radar data easier to understand by the audience we wanted to reach.
    </p>
    

    <h2>DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p>The main aim of our project is to make Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images understandable regardless of age. In pursuing this goal, our first step was to find examples that would facilitate the 
        chosen project, investigate the issues in the examples we found, and add our own knowledge on top of them. We searched for solutions to problems, addressed key points, utilized the 
        methods we found, and, through observations, reached conclusions to complete our project.
       The points we addressed in the project are the effects of lava from a volcanic eruption on the environment and living beings. One of the effects we consider a result from this situation 
       is acid rain caused by the release of carbon dioxide into the air after a volcanic eruption. The impact of acid rains can result in environmental issues, particularly in 
       agriculture. One of the simplest examples of the impact of a volcanic eruption on living beings is the spread of ashes due to a volcanic eruption, which, when inhaled by humans, can lead to diseases 
       such as cancer and asthma. The problem we identified when choosing the project is that radar images do not appeal to all ages, create confusion in the colors of SAR images, and difficulty for 
       people to fully understand radar images that are usually represented in a 2D plane. The methods we used in the project involve transferring the SAR data of pre and post volcanic eruption to a 3D 
       plane and color-coding it with colors that are easier to distinguish. To facilitate accessibility and examination of our project, we also created a website. The observation made in the project involved 
       researching the working principle of SAR, its purpose, and similar characteristics using all available sources. We contemplated how to make SAR data, which does not appeal to all ages and is hard to 
       understand, more comprehensible. As a result, we decided to model a volcanic eruption, a specific incident, in a 3D manner. We thought about how we could interpret the most crucial aspect of SAR data, 
       the color palette, and consulted experts in the field. To better reach our target audience, we decided to create a website. In conclusion we interpreted SAR data 
       with an original approach using the 3D model we created, making complex radar data more understandable for the audience we intended to reach.

    <center><h1>THE SARTICLE</h1></center>
<h2>WHAT IS SAR?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar">Synthetic Aperture Radars </a>, 
    or SAR is a type of active data collection where a sensor produces its own energy
    and then records the energy reflected back after interacting with the Earth. 
    While optical imagery is similar to interpreting a photograph, SAR data requires a different way of 
    thinking in that the signal is instead responsive to surface characteristics like structure and moisture. </p>
<center><img src="sartists 1.jpg"></center>
<h2>THE ROLE OF FREQUENCY AND WAVELENGHT</h2>
<p>Optical sensors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational Land Imager"> 
    Landsat's Operational Land Imager (OLI) </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2">Sentinel-2</a>'s
    <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/taxonomy/term/289">Multispectral Instrument (MSI)
    </a> collect data in the visible, near-infrared,
    and short-wave infrared portions of the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro/">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. 
    Radar sensors utilize longer wavelengths at the centimeter to meter scale, which gives it special properties, 
    such as the ability to see through clouds. Wavelenghth is an important feature to consider when working with SAR, 
    as it determines how the radar signal interacts with the surface and how far a signal can penetrate into a medium.</p>
    <center><img src="sar gif.gif" alt=""></center>
<h2>POLARIZATION AND SCATTERING MECHANISMS</h2>
<p> Radar can also collect signals in different polarizations, 
    by controlling the analyzed polarization in both the transmit and receive paths. 
    While the orientation can occur at any angle, SAR sensors typically transmit linearly polarized. 
    Signals emitted in vertical (V) and received in horizontal (H) polarization would be indicated by a VH.  
    Alternatively, a signal that was emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H) would be indicated by HH, 
    and so on. Examining the signal strength from these different polarizations carries information about the structure of 
    the imaged surface, based on the following types of scattering: rough surface, volume, and double bounce. </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Rough surface scattering, such as that caused by bare soil or water, is most sensitive to VV scattering.</li>
    <li>Volume scattering, for example, caused by the leaves and branches in a forest canopy, 
        is most sensitive to cross-polarized data like VH or HV.</li>
    <li>The last type of scattering, double bounce, is caused by buildings, tree trunks, or inundated vegetation and is most 
        sensitive to an HH polarized signal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to note that the amount of signal attributed to different scattering types may change as 
        a function of wavelength, as wavelength changes the penetration depth of the signal.</p>
    <center><img src="polarization_imagery.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<h2>INTERFEROMETRIC SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (InSAR)</h2>
    <p>SAR data can also enable an analysis method called 
        <a href="https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/get-to-know-sar/interferometry/">interferometry</a>, or InSAR. 
        Interferometry is an imaging technique in which waves are superimposed in a manner to cause interference. 
        NISAR will use interferometry to compare three-dimensional observations of the same scene on Earth to reveal surface 
        motion and change. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques combine two or more SAR images over 
        the same region to reveal surface topography or surface motion. If the combined SAR images originate from slightly 
        different positions, the topography of the surface can be mapped. In contrast, if images from the same position but 
        taken at different times are combined, the difference between them will show motion, or deformation, of the surface in
        the time between the two images. InSAR uses the phase information recorded by the sensor to measure the distance from 
        the sensor to the target. These measurements are very accurate (up to the centimeter level!) and can be used to 
        identify areas of deformation from events like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.</p>
    <center><img src="InSAR_deformation_geometry.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<h2>WHAT IS NISAR?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/quick-facts/">The NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Mission</a> will be the first 
        radar of its kind in space to systematically map Earth, 
        using two different radar frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes of our planet's surface, including 
        movements as small as a centimeter. This allows the mission to observe a wide range of Earth processes, from the flow rates of glaciers and ice sheets to the dynamics of earthquakes and volcanoes.

        NISAR uses a sophisticated information-processing technique which we also know as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to produce extremely high-resolution images. 
        Radar penetrates clouds and darkness, enabling NISAR to collect data day and night in any weather. The instrument's imaging swath — the width of the strip of data collected 
        along the length of the orbit track — is greater than 150 miles (240 kilometers), which allows it to image the entire Earth in 12 days.
